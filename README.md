# Blitz Plugin for Craft CMS 3

> The Blitz v2 branch is currently in a release candidate phase. For the stable version, please visit the [v1 branch](https://github.com/putyourlightson/craft-blitz/tree/v1). The beta version can be installed using composer as follows.

```
composer require putyourlightson/craft-blitz:2.0.0-RC2
```

The Blitz plugin provides intelligent full page caching for creating lightning-fast sites with [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/).

- Reduces page load times (TTFB) and load on the server significantly. 
- Makes your site available even when performing updates and maintenance.
- Makes it possible to have your site served by a content delivery network (CDN).

Although the performance gains depend on the individual site and server setup, the following results are not uncommon (on a 5 Mbps cable connection with 28ms of latency). Google recommends a server response time of [200ms or less](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/Server).
